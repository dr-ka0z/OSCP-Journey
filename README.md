# OSCP-Journey
This is a collection of all the code i had written while preparing for the OSCP certification,  the original purpose is for it to be useful to my workflow, nevertheless i hope it may be beneficial for someone else.

All of this code is to be used for educational and legal purposes, crearly focussed on ethical hacking and legal penetration Testing. 

I am not responsible for any missuse of this software, it is just knowledge, and if you choose to do something not so smart or even ilegal it is on you.

If you want to contribute or anything feel free, for the moment it is just a collection of small scripts in python, bash, batch, powershell or anything alike.
